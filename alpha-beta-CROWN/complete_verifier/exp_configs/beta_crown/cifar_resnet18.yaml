  alpha-crown:
    iteration: 100   # Number of iterations for alpha-CROWN optimization. Alpha-CROWN is used to compute all intermediate layer bounds before branch and bound starts.
    lr_alpha: 0.1    # Learning rate for alpha in alpha-CROWN. The default (0.1) is typically ok.
  beta-crown:
    lr_alpha: 0.01  # Learning rate for optimizing the alpha parameters, the default (0.01) is typically ok, but you can try to tune this parameter to get better lower bound.
    lr_beta: 0.05  # Learning rate for optimizing the beta parameters, the default (0.05) is typically ok, but you can try to tune this parameter to get better lower bound.
    iteration: 20  # Number of iterations for beta-CROWN optimization. 20 is often sufficient, 50 or 100 can also be used.
bab:
  timeout: 300  # Timeout threshold for branch and bound. Increase for verifying more points.
  branching:  # Parameters for branching heuristics.
    reduceop: min  # Reduction function for the branching heuristic scores, min or max. Using max can be better on some models.
    method: kfsb  # babsr is fast but less accurate; fsb is slow but most accurate; kfsb is usually a balance.
